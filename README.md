# Jahnavi Maddhuri: Python Script interacting with SQL Database
This project was originally started for the course, IDS 702: Data Engineering.
The purpose of this project is to provide analysis on a dataset using pandas and Jupyter notebooks in a python project template with a strong build system.
This creates a base feedback loop every time I update my project.
