# Jahnavi Maddhuri: Python Script interacting with SQL Database
This project demonstrates the use of Python to interact with a SQL database through SQLite, leveraging the [bad-drivers.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bad-drivers/bad-drivers.csv) dataset. It implements an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline along with key Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) SQL commands. The project is designed with a robust build system that ensures continuous feedback and updates as the code evolves.
